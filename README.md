 # Project Proposal: Music Player
 
 
 ## Project Goals
 Developing a music player will provide many different challenges that I will have to overcome. It will really test my knowledge on what we have learned through out this course. My goals are to become more comfortable with state management, lifecycle methods, and imporoving my css skills. I would also like to make sure that this web app is responsive.
 
 ## Tech Stack
 #### First Party Tools
 - React for building the interface
 - Node/express for communicating data with the React application.

 #### Third Party Tools
 - Spotify API to get music data

 ## Features and Deliverables
 - Main page will contain a search bar to search whatever song the user wants to listen to. 
 - The search will take the user to a search results page that will display all the search results, and from there the user will be able to click play on that specific song. As well as get details on that artist.
 - The main page will disply a list of music genres that the user can click on that will take them to playlists of that specific genre. 
 - From there the user will be able to play that playlist, and change songs within that playlist.

 #### Future Deliverables
 - Authentication/Authorization
 - Users are able to make and save their own playlists.
 - A mobile app version of the online auction
